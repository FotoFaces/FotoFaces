# Test
To test the implementation of the algorithm of the old fotofaces and the algorithm done by a student in master degree. 
We created 3 tests.

## Test.py
This script test the algorithm of the studet in master degreed and this was the result:

![test 1 result](https://github.com/FotoFaces/Fotofaces/src/plugins/Sunglasses/tests/images/test1.png)

This algorithm passes all the tests except the one with this image:

![sunglasses_2](https://github.com/FotoFaces/Fotofaces/src/plugins/Sunglasses/tests/images/sunglasses_2.png)



## Test2.py
This script test the algorithm of the old fotofaces:

![test 1 result](https://github.com/FotoFaces/Fotofaces/src/plugins/Sunglasses/tests/images/test2.png)

This algorithm passes all the tests except the one with this image:

![sunglasses_2](https://github.com/FotoFaces/Fotofaces/src/plugins/Sunglasses/tests/images/sunglasses_7.png)

## Test3.py
Since both scripts have their strength and weakness and those weakness don't collide. we decide to implement a algorithm composed of the two of them:

![test 1 result](https://github.com/FotoFaces/Fotofaces/src/plugins/Sunglasses/tests/images/test2.png)

With this aproach we can pass all tests
