# testing another algorithm 

This algorithm was found in this blog https://towardsdatascience.com/automatic-image-quality-assessment-in-python-391a6be52c11

## Results 

This algorithm evaluates better the quality of the images (bad quality images have a higher score). However, the algorithm can't read 3 of the images "vicente.png" due to be in a png format and two of the bad quality images (in jpg format)
